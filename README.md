I'm a big fan of the show Have You Been Paying Attention? (HYBPA?). Its a hilarious Australian panel game television show that mixes comedy with weekly news, and is sometimes my only source of news for the week.

I pulled the winner from each episode from the episode list on Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Have_You_Been_Paying_Attention%3F_episodes  
 and did some analysis on the performances of the panelists. Last updated 03/05/2022, so no results from Season 10 *yet*.
